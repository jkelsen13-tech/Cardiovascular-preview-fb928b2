# Anatomical heart assets: attribution and limitations

The base64-packaged GLB payloads in model-data.js are exact bytes from the HuBMAP HRA CCF 3D Reference Object Library. They are decoded in memory by the local GLTFLoader. No CDN, remote model request, decoder download, analytics, or API is used at runtime. This packaging supports opening either HTML entry point directly with file://.

Geometry bytes are unchanged. App modifications are base64 transport packaging, runtime orientation/recentering, new materials, clipping distant vascular continuations to the local heart view, clipping for cutaway, modest illustrative chamber scaling, and independently authored conduction/blood-flow overlays. No mesh is represented as a measured conduction pathway.

## Mesh inventory and budget
Heart: 14 meshes, 43,560 vertices, 85,914 triangles.
Vasculature: 37 meshes, 62,827 vertices, 123,064 triangles.
Combined: 51 meshes, 106,387 vertices, 208,978 triangles; no textures.
Base64 transport is 5,677,489 bytes. This is not geometry optimization; it increases transport by about one third to preserve offline file access. Original binary files are not duplicated in this repository. Full hashes, nodes and the bundled runtime size are recorded in model-manifest.json.

Runtime dependency: three@0.180.0 with GLTFLoader, locally bundled from the official npm package; MIT license in ../vendor/THREE-LICENSE.txt. No OrbitControls, compression decoder, physics engine, or textures. esbuild@0.25.10 is a build-only dependency, not shipped as runtime software.

## Teaching limitations
This is a reference anatomy illustration, not a clinical simulation. Chamber movement and directed blood paths teach phase relationships and do not calculate pressure, volume, velocity, valve dynamics, or exact electromechanical timing. Anatomical valve meshes are separate and visible in cutaway; they are not animated as physiologically measured leaflets.

The upstream mapping has conflicting left/right inferior pulmonary vein labels. All pulmonary vein labels here are generic PV. No inferior pulmonary vein laterality is asserted. The source meshes and coordinate relationships remain unchanged.

The front basis is derived from RA→LA, orthogonalized against the IVC→SVC superior direction. Viewer-left is patient-right in that front view. Rotation changes screen positions; a persistent orientation note and Reset / front view explain this.

The original viewer now adds qualified annular cut faces to static source vessels at display crop planes, leaving the inner lumen open. Gold is a toggleable teaching wall overlay. Myocardial cutaways and ambiguous/solid-only source vessel sections remain uncapped; this is not a watertight surgical specimen. Source geometry is not inflated. Conduction nodes, bundle branches, Purkinje branches and blood arrows are schematic overlays using chamber/valve landmarks. Overlay depth testing is disabled to keep these teaching paths visible through exterior anatomy.

P illustrates atrial depolarization and contraction/filling; PR illustrates AV delay and filling; QRS illustrates His–Purkinje ventricular activation followed by contraction/ejection; ST illustrates continued depolarization/ejection; T illustrates repolarization/relaxation; TP illustrates baseline/passive filling. U has no invented mechanical event.

## Mobile and accessibility
DPR is capped at 1.5; antialiasing and textures are disabled. Rendering stops when paused, offscreen, hidden, or the module closes. Reduced motion uses static directional arrows; play still steps the textual stages. Controls have 44px minimum targets, keyboard orbit/zoom, checkbox labels, and a textual structure/flow key. The simplified SVG stays available and is the automatic fallback if loading/WebGL fails.

No real iPhone hardware performance claim is made. Hosted Chromium portrait checks are emulation, not Safari/iOS certification.
